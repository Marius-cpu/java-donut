# java-donut
An attempt to make the famous donut written in C  in a donut form, this isn't really like a donut from the code point of view, but the visuals are looking donut-ish

# Running the code
Open CMD and type cd Desktop //make sure you have saved the JAR file to your desktop
after that, write java -jar Donut.jar

# The code
You can edit the code so the donut doesnt print out every single time, i have no idea tho
